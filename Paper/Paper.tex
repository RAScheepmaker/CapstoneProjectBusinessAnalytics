\input{Introduction.tex}
% Your outline should have the following structure: In the first section, provide a brief description of your topic, including some institutional information that will make possible an evaluation of the theoretical model you have chosen, to be presented in a later section. 

\input{Literature.tex}
% In the next section, present a summary of what other authors have written on your topic.

\input{Theory.tex}
% In the third section, present your theoretical model, pointing out the implications of the model for the business problem you are trying to solve. 

\input{Empirical-Model.tex}
% From your theoretical model, then develop an empirical specification within which you can provide a business or economic or behavioral interpretation in the fourth section. 

\input{Data.tex}
% In the fifth section, describe the sources from which you intend to draw the data necessary in training the empirical specification. 
% This will involve a complete description of each variable you intend to use from each source as well as a listing of the formulae you intend to use in transforming these variables into measures which are germane to your project.

\input{Results.tex}
% a discussion of the economic or behavioral interpretations for the model’s parameters;
% a description of how the parameters of the empirical model were estimated and a presentation of the results;
% an interpretation of the empirical results in light of the economic and statistical models;
% a discussion of the policy implications of your empirical results;

\input{Conclusions.tex}
% a concluding section in which you describe what you learned from the project and summarize your results and their policy implications;

% ..you must document the construction of your dataset clearly and completely. This will involve providing the following:
% (1) the correct bibliographic references, as described in section 2.1;
% (2) a complete definition and description of all variables used;
% (3) a complete description of the formulae used in manipulating the raw data to obtain the variables you ultimately employed;
% (4) a summary table of descriptive statistics for the variables used in your work.
% This sort of description should be done in a Data Appendix and presented at the end of the paper—after any acknowledgements, but before the references.
