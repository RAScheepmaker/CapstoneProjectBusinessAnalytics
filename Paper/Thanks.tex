This capstone project would not have been possible without Dr.~Harry Paarsch. 
I would like to thank him for all his teachings and guidance throughout the last year, and for his book with Dr.~Konstantin Golyaev \citep{paargoly:2016}.
He made me realize that economics is much closer to a real (natural) science than I always feared. 
I would also like to thank all the other professors that made this first cohort of the Business Analytics program possible: Dr.~Lealand Morin, Dr.~Alexander Mantzaris, and Dr.~Majid Mahzoon for their software and data visualization classes. 
Dr.~Michael Tseng for his math class and Dr.~Nizam Uddin for his class on probability and statistics. 
I thank Dr.~Morgan Wang for introducing me to SAS, and I would like to thank Mr.~Joshua Eubanks for teaching me my first microeconomics class.
I would also like to thank Ms.~Meredith Smart for enrolling me exactly on schedule, every Friday before the start of the semester.

Finally, I would like to thank my fellow Business Analytics students from the 2023--2024 cohort, who made going back to school after 15 years a lot more fun. 
Malak, Kelly, Cody, Jared, Manoj, Nili, Frank, Danielle, Yasmeen, Anabella, and Avery: thanks for all the discussions, and for putting up with me and my Dutch directness. 
I'm wishing you all the best in your future careers, wherever those may bring you. 
Go Knights, and stay curious!
