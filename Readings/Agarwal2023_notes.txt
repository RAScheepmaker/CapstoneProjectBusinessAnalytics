Regardless of income, sophisticated individuals profit from reward credit cards at the expense of naive consumers.
Estimated aggregate annual redistribution of $15 billion from less to more educated, poorer to richer, and high to low minority areas, widening existing disparities.

sub-prime: < 660
near-prime: 660-720
prime: 720-780
super-prime: >780

Super-prime cardholders earn on average \$9.5 per month on reward carsds. High-income super-prime benefit the most: \$20.1 in net rewards per month, relative to classic credit cards, at the expense of HIGH-INCOME (not low) consumers with low FICO scores.

FICO Scores correlate with financial sophistication, not income.

For sub-prime holders, bank's revenue is more than 60 percent from interest income, while for super-prime holders, up to 80 percent is from interchange income. 

"High-FICO consumers rake in the benefits while avoiding the costs of reward credit cards and therefore profit from usage, while low-FICO consumers incur high costs due to high interest charges."

"Financial Sophistication: the ability of consumers to make informed decisions and avoid mistakes in the use of financial products."
